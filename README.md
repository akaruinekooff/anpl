# 🐾 AkaruiNeko Public License (ANPL)

Welcome to the official repository of the **AkaruiNeko Public License (ANPL)**.  
ANPL is a license created by [AkaruiNeko](https://github.com/AkaruiNekoOFF) in 2025.  
It’s designed to keep software **free for learning, sharing, and community use** — but **not for profit or harm**.

---

## ✨ Key Points (TL;DR)

- ✅ **Free to use** — you can use the code for personal, educational, or research projects.  
- ✅ **Modify & share** — you can adapt, improve, and redistribute, as long as you keep this license attached.  
- 🚫 **No commercial use** — you can’t sell, monetize, or use the code in paid services.  
- 🚫 **No malicious use** — phishing, malware, or other harmful activities are strictly forbidden.  
- 📜 **License must stay** — the license text and copyright notice must remain in all copies.  
- ⚖️ **No warranty** — the software comes “as is”; the author takes no responsibility for any problems.

## 📖 Why ANPL?

Unlike MIT, GPL, or MPL, this license has a different philosophy:  
- It **gives freedom to individuals, students, and hobbyists**.  
- It **blocks corporations or sellers** from taking the code and profiting.  
- It **adds a moral clause** to stop harmful uses.  

ANPL is not OSI-approved (because it restricts commercial use),  
but it’s intentional — it’s meant to protect code from abuse, not to maximize corporate adoption.
